              Molarity (also called molar concentration, amount concentration or
              substance concentration) is a measure of the concentration of a
              chemical species, in particular, of a solute in a solution, in
              terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution.

          In chemistry, molarity (M) is a concentration unit, defined to be the
          number of moles of solute divided by the number of liters of solution.
          It is one of the most common concentration units, so it's important to
          understand how it's calculated and when to use it versus when to use
          another unit. It's an important skill to master for chemistry
          students, so{" "}
